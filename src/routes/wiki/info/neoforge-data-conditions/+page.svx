# Neo/Forge data loading conditions

Both Forge and Neoforge have additional datapack functionality where both modders and modpack developers can dynamically disable/enable data files based on given criteria. These criteria can range from checking if a tag/item exists in the registry, or simply disabling the file in it's entirety.
